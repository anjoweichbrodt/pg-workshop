# Call for applications
## Photogrammetry Workshop Plovdiv

A preconference workshop for photogrammetry will be organized the weekend prior to ICCMs 14th conference in Plovdiv at the end of October 2022. It is aimed at students and professionals from the conservation community who have a strong interest in documentation, photography and who are happy to learn and work with PC and Software. The on site work will evolve around the shelter and museum of the Great Basilica in Plovdiv.

A number of 8 participants will be admitted to the workshop, who will be selected based on their application and a representative composition of the group. Participants are invited to bring their own camera and laptop. Where this is not possible we can organize equipment for the site work.

Initial theoretical content and PC preparation support will be provided through online lectures to be scheduled during the end of September and beginning of October.

To apply please send a CV no longer than 2 pages to:
